# Campus Energy and Renewables Management Platform

## Team Information
Team Name: 27_EnerTrack  
Domain: Sustainability and Green Economy  
Problem Statement: Campus Energy and Renewables Management  

## Problem Statement

With increasing energy demands and rising environmental concerns, educational campuses are required to adopt efficient energy management and sustainable practices. Campuses consist of multiple buildings with varied energy consumption patterns, making manual monitoring inefficient and inaccurate.

The Campus Energy and Renewables Management Platform provides a centralized, web-based system to monitor electricity consumption, track renewable energy generation, estimate costs and carbon footprint, detect anomalies, and generate sustainability reports. The system enables data-driven decision-making, reduces energy wastage, and supports alignment with green economy principles.

## Identified Actors

System Administrator  
Responsible for configuring, monitoring, and maintaining the platform, including user management, system configuration, and system-level reporting.

Finance Analyst  
A view-only role responsible for tracking utility expenditures, analyzing energy-related costs, and evaluating the financial impact of energy consumption and sustainability initiatives.

Technician  
An operational staff member responsible for responding to real-time alerts, diagnosing system faults, and performing maintenance activities on campus energy infrastructure.

Sustainability Officer  
Responsible for managing sustainability initiatives, tracking environmental impact metrics such as emissions, and preparing sustainability and compliance reports.
