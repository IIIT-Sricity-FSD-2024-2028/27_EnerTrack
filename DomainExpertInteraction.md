## Domain Context and Terminology

  The purpose of this problem aligns with improving service delivery and sustainability by shifting focus from mere infrastructure creation to reliable operations, maintenance, real-time monitoring, and behavioral change. It supports evidence-based decision-making and long-term environmental resilience.
 
 Primary Goals and Outcomes of our problem statement:
  - Reduce energy wastage across campus infrastructure  
  - Improve reliability and uptime of electrical services  
  - Enable smart and predictive maintenance  
  - Provide auditable, outcome-based sustainability metrics  
  - Support phased adoption of renewable energy  

| Term | Meaning as explained by the expert |
|---|---|
| Sustainability | Ensuring systems operate without breaking natural, resource, or institutional cycles |
| Service continuity | Reliable and uninterrupted delivery of essential services |
| Outcome-based monitoring | Measuring real, verifiable impact instead of activities |
| Carbon footprint | Emissions generated directly or indirectly through energy consumption |
| Water footprint | Total water consumption including indirect usage |
| Smart maintenance | Predictive, data-driven maintenance instead of reactive fixes |
| Behavioral change | Shifting user habits to reduce resource consumption |
| Baseline data | Initial verified data used for comparison and audits |

## Actors and Responsibilities

| Actor / Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| System Administrator | Manages users, roles, system configuration, dashboards, and data integrity |
| Maintenance Staff | Receives alerts, performs repairs, logs downtime and restoration details |
| Finance / Utility Officer | Reviews electricity consumption, utility costs, and budget projections |
| Sustainability Officer | Monitors environmental impact, carbon metrics, and compliance reports |


## Core workflows

### Workflow 1: Energy Downtime & Maintenance Management
- **Trigger/start condition:** Power tripping, equipment failure, or outage
- **Steps involved (in order):**
  1. Downtime detected or reported
  2. Alert generated for maintenance staff
  3. Maintenance activity performed
  4. Restoration time and cause recorded
- **Outcome / End condition:**  
  Power restored and downtime metrics updated for analysis

### Workflow 2: Sustainability Performance Monitoring
- **Trigger/start condition:** Periodic review (daily/monthly/annual)
- **Steps involved (in order):**
  1. Energy usage data collected
  2. Carbon footprint calculated based on energy source
  3. Comparison with baseline and targets
- **Outcome / End condition:**  
  Sustainability reports generated for decision-making

### Workflow 3: Long-term Green Energy Planning
- **Trigger/start condition:** Institutional decision to improve sustainability
- **Steps involved (in order):**
  1. Establish baseline energy consumption
  2. Define phased renewable energy targets
  3. Track progress using system metrics
  4. Apply corrective actions if targets are missed
- **Outcome / End condition:**  
  Gradual transition towards a greener and more resilient campus energy system

## Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions
- **Mandatory rules or policies:**  
  - Data must be auditable and evidence-backed  
  - Metrics should be outcome-focused rather than activity-based  
- **Constraints or limitations:**  
  - Dependence on external power grids  
  - Budget and infrastructure limitations  
- **Common exceptions or edge cases:**  
  - Increase in energy consumption due to campus expansion  
  - Grid-level failures beyond campus control  
- **Situations where things usually go wrong:**  
  - Poor data quality or missing baselines  
  - Lack of institutional ownership  
  - Ignoring behavioral aspects of sustainability  

## Current challenges and pain points
- Absence of a centralized reporting and grievance platform  
- Reactive maintenance leading to frequent downtime  
- Difficulty in tracking real-time energy usage and wastage  
- Sustainability often treated as a buzzword rather than a measurable process  

## Assumptions & Clarifications
- **What assumptions made by the team that were confirmed:**  
  - Sustainability challenges are largely behavioral and institutional  
  - Digital platforms can significantly improve service delivery and accountability  
- **What assumptions that were corrected:**  
  - Sustainability is not only about technology, but also governance, data quality, and lifecycle thinking  
- **Open questions that need follow-up:**  
  - Availability of real-time energy meters across campus  
  - Institutional readiness to adopt long-term green energy plans
